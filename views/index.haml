      %section.ruled.info
        %h2 How does this work?
        %p
          When you purchase an hour, I will get in touch via email as quickly as possible and schedule your time. The scheduling will depend on the nature of your problem, whether or not we'll need to be in touch during the work, and my current availability. I will make every attempt to get your hour scheduled within 2 business days of your purchase.

        %p
          %strong
            Your credit card will not be charged until your hour is scheduled at a time that works for you. However, if your problem is extremely time sensitive, I reccomend contacting me ahead of time to ensure I can accomodate you.

        %p
          If, after this hour, it makes sense for us to continue working together beyond your hour, we'll set up a new contract and rate for your project, and get cracking.

        %p
          If you're in Columbus, Ohio, we can arrange to meet for your hour in person, if you prefer.

        %p
          The eventual charge to your credit card will appear from Crater Creative, LLC

        %h2 Any other questions?
        %p
          The best way to get in touch with me is through the form above or
